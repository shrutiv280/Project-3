**Expense Tracker**

This Python code snippet provides a simplified Expense Tracker system. It allows users to add daily expenses, categorize them, view monthly summaries of their expenses, save the expenses to a file, and load expenses from a file.The code uses a list called expenses to store expense data as dictionaries. Functions are defined to perform various tasks such as adding expenses (add_expense), calculating monthly summaries (monthly_summary), saving expenses to a file (save_expenses), and loading expenses from a file (load_expenses).
Example expenses are added, and their monthly summary is printed. Then, the expenses are saved to a file named "expenses.json". After that, the expenses are loaded from the file, and the monthly summary is printed again to ensure that the loading process was successful.

**3.Saving Expenses:** Expenses can be saved to a file in JSON format for later retrieval.

These features provide basic functionality for users to input, manage, and analyze their expenses over time.
